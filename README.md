# Task Manager Application

A modern, feature-rich Task Management application built with Spring Boot, demonstrating best practices in web application development. This project serves as a showcase of AI-driven development using Cascade AI Agent in the Windsurf editor.

## Overview

This Task Manager is a web application that helps users organize and track their tasks efficiently. What makes this project unique is that the entire codebase was generated by the Cascade AI Agent with minimal human supervision, demonstrating the capabilities of modern AI-assisted development.

The application is being developed incrementally, with new features being added in a series of development iterations, each documented in video format showing the interaction between human developer and AI agent.

## AI-Driven Development

This project showcases:
- Full codebase generation by Cascade AI Agent
- Best practices in software development automatically applied by AI
- Human-AI collaboration in software development
- Practical application of AI agents in real-world projects

## Features

## Development Branches

The project is organized into feature branches, each representing a significant development milestone:

- [`feature/task-api-foundation`](https://github.com/esurovtsev/task-manager/tree/feature/task-api-foundation): Initial API implementation with core task management functionality
  - [Watch the development video](https://youtu.be/BPaF68MU4aM?si=7NnMAw4zf2Ed6Zbe) to see how this foundation was built using Cascade AI Agent
- More branches will be added as new features are developed

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher

### Building the Project
```bash
mvn clean install
```
